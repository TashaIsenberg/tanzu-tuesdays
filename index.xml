      <description>&amp;ldquo;TDD leads to a great design&amp;rdquo; - they said. &amp;ldquo;Mocking is bad&amp;rdquo; - they said. &amp;ldquo;Integration testing is slow&amp;rdquo; - they said. &amp;ldquo;Testable architecture to the rescue&amp;rdquo; - they said. &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t test, don&amp;rsquo;t call yourself a developer!&amp;rdquo; - they said. &amp;ldquo;Code coverage must be 100%&amp;rdquo; - they said.
&amp;hellip; and so on and so forth.
In this talk we will tackle some of the testing gotchas. There will be live coding, architecture rants, some slides and (hopefully) much fun.</description>

      <title>Reactive Revolution with Josh Long</title>

      <description>Microservices and big-data increasingly confront us with the limitations of traditional input/output. In traditional IO, work that is IO-bound dominates threads. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensive on the JVM, and most other platforms. Even if threads were cheap and infinitely scalable, we’d still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks. Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways.</description>

      <description>Jakub is a Developer Advocate at VMware, blogger, programmer, and trainer. He loves to tackle complex enterprises with Domain-Driven Design, Test-Driven Development and Spring. Architecture is a main area of interest, too. When he doesn&amp;rsquo;t program, he rides motorbikes, skis or practices kitesurfing. Here is his DZone MVB awarded blog: https://pillopl.github.io and his pet projects can be found here: https://github.com/ddd-by-examples.</description>
